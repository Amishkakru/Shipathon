In 2024, Google unveiled Willow, a revolutionary quantum computer chip that redefines computational limits. Capable of completing a benchmark task in just 5 minutes—a feat that would take the fastest classical supercomputers 10 septillion years—Willow operates with an astounding 105 qubits and boasts reduced error rates.

This breakthrough marks a critical step toward practical quantum computing, bringing us closer to scalable and transformative technologies. Willow isn't just a chip; it's a milestone shaping the future of science and innovation.
