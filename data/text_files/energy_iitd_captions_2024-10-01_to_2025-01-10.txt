On November 6, 2024, Energy Society led a team of enthusiasts for an educational trip to NISE Delhi. This visit was an incredible opportunity to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical applications taking a deep dive into the cutting edge technologies currently being used.

🚀What we have explored at NISE?

📢 Live demonstration of various solar thermal and solar PV Applications comprising of auxiliary components of the NISE premises like solar heater, solar iron, solar dryer, solar cooker, instant solar geyser, solar cold storage, etc.

📢 The importance of Solar Testing, Certification & Resource assessment and NISE’s role in ensuring the quality and reliability of solar components.

📢 The state-of-the-art labs at NISE showcased research in solar energy generation as well as integration. From testing PV modules under simulated conditions to studying the efficiency of solar inverters, the labs are a testament to the strides being made in advancing solar technologies.

📢 India's first solar based Hydrogen generating plant directly coupled to the Solar Power plant, unlike other Hydrogen stations worldwide.

📢A 500 KWp solar PV plant, where we got a close look to diverse PV panels and technologies including monocrystalline, polycrystalline, heterojunction, CIGS.

📢Insights into international collaborations with organizations like the IEA and partnerships with premier institutes to globally accelerate solar energy adoption.

Energy Society is thankful to Mr. Arup Dhar, Deputy Director, NISE for his insights, dedication, and effort to ensure we gain maximum knowledge within such a short period of visit.

We are grateful to Prof. Kaushik Saha and Prof. K Ravi Kumar for ideating and encouraging for this highly impactful visit to NISE.
