Caption: Seeing the overwhelming engagement on the last post, BSP is back with the October edition of “This Month in Pictures.”. 

This month was packed with many exciting and insightful events, ranging from exhilarating events at Rendezvous to talks from Turing award recipients, from achievements in sports to the Inter IIT Tech meet selections. Oh and not to mention the beautiful Diwali and Dusshera celebrations on campus ;). This was probably one of the more eventful months of the year. 

On a somber note, Kumar Yash, a master’s student in the Cognitive Science department at IIT Delhi, passed away this month. Our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones.

Caption: In this edition of Muse, we have a collection of short stories and poems accumulated over the past year from readers to serve as a kaleidoscope of expression. The theme for this muse was centred around a feeling of constancy in an ever-changing world, or simply put, “Holding on to our Anchors”. In a world where everyone is more or less permanently in a state of bewilderment, it becomes more and more important to hold on to something that grounds you and prevents you from being washed away in the tide of an ever-busy life.
