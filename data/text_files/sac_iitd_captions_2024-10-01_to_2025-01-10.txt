The Student Affairs Council (SAC), in collaboration with the Co-Curricular and Academic Interaction Council (CAIC), is excited to announce the Call a friend program. 

The program pairs final-year students currently appearing for placements with batchmates who are already placed. These mentors, having successfully navigated the placement process, are uniquely positioned to provide invaluable guidance, share experiences, and offer empathetic support to their friends.

Recognizing the stressful moments outside LHC cubicles, where incoming candidates anxiously seek for even the slightest insights into interview patterns and questions from their peers, longing for guidance, SAC has introduced a formal mechanism to bridge this gap. 

This initiative aims to turn your challenges into stepping stones, empowering students to achieve clarity and success with the help of their peers. 

Eligibility: Final-year students who are appearing for placements in the 2024‚Äì25 session. 

Applications are now open!

Caption: Placement season can be one of the most stressful times for students, with countless applications, interviews, and the pressure to perform.

Whether you‚Äôre feeling stuck, anxious, or just need someone to talk to, this support can make a big difference. Remember, taking care of your mental health is just as important as preparing for placements! üí¨‚ú®
