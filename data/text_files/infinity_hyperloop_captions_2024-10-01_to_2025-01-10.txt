Behind every great innovation is a moment of hard work, teamwork, and a little bit of cutting-edge (literally!). Here's a glimpse of our team working on cutting the carbon fiber sheets that will power the Infinity Hyperloop project. 

Carbon fiber isn’t just a material—it’s a symbol of strength, flexibility, and innovation, just like our vision for the future of transportation.

This project wouldn't be possible without the incredible collaboration of every team member. Here's to dreaming big and working even harder!

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all our sponsors for their unwavering belief in us and their confidence that we can drive the change the world needs. @schandgroup, @lpsbossardindia, @rosenberger.group, @3dconnexion, @fabhotels, @solidworks, @ansys_inc
