Caption: Arush and I bonded over multiple things at once. Be it the innumerable quizzing sets that we solved together at the most random times‚Äî during free lecture slots, in Jwala CR/mess, on the journey to and back from DU colleges, etc.‚Äî or the god-knows-how-many jamming sessions we held together that ended up expanding my taste in music dramatically. Very well-known as the GOAT of MELA genre, our teamups in internals and externals had him answering the majority of questions while a dumbstruck me just sat there in awe of what I was witnessing. His ability to accurately recollect almost every single art piece he'd seen in museums in Europe as an exchange student there was unnerving, to say the least. Apart from being a human Shazam, Arush is a living, breathing song-filtering program as well‚Äî ask him for music bands of an obscure genre with female vocals from a random decade and he'd present you with an unending list on the spot. Performing duets of California Dreamin' with him was perhaps one of the most memorable days of my life in this college. The philosophical discussions that would sometimes follow these jams were just cherry on top.

It would be a crime to neglect to mention his love for puzzles and proficiency at crosswords, and he might have ended up giving dozens of people a lifelong addiction to the same through his unmatched enthusiasm. An extrovert par excellence without the hint of any social anxiety, his list of friends and acquaintances is so extensive that you would end up getting added to a group dedicated to some concert many months into the future and not know half the people there. Well, just one look at his academic record and list of ECAs comprising not just QLD but also dance and music events certainly helps explain part of it.

It is unfortunate that we only became really good friends in his final year here‚Äî the immensely positive influence that he's had on me and so many others will never be forgotten. IITD QC will miss having this multi-talented gem in our midst.

Caption: 'Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it' I think Ye was talking about Amba at cracking fundae. From knowing about the most bizarre anime, to the paintings of Monet, Amba is who many would consider the ideal fit to MELA quizzing.

I first met Amba in my second year on the way to the Fandom and SBT quizzes at AIIMS. He'd qualified for the finals and my team had missed out narrowly, and so I began spectating the remainder of the quiz. It was extremely cool to find a senior in IITD who hadn't lost their inner sense of 'Bangalorean'. Mamba is always energetic, yet mellow and a really fun guy to hang around with.  Be it sitting through SBT quizzes together and pouncing on every other question, co-qming Literati Fandom, or regular conversations on WhatsApp, Amba has an aura that is hard to come across but also hard not to match.

He is the ultimate definition of 'vibe-quizzer': the person who's gonna crack not just questions but jokes too. Whether he was acting as a pillar for Zanskar QC, or grabbing podiums in other internals and externals, Amba was very often in a league of his own.

Here's wishing our @cant_a_gawa star all the best for his journey¬†ahead¬†<3
