Caption: Continuing our exploration of intriguing concepts in mathematics, we’re excited to invite you to the next talk in our series! 🎉 This session takes us into the intersection of mathematics and quantum mechanics, offering insight into the fascinating world of Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) and their applications. Whether you’re drawn to quantum theory or just curious about the structure of quantum tests, this talk promises to be an enlightening experience! 📊

*Topic*: An Introductory Look into Mutually Unbiased Bases
*Speaker*: Uditanshu Sadual

*Abstract*:
In quantum mechanics, two tests are considered complementary if the outcome of one reveals no information about the other. This idea is formalised through mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). For a complex space of dimension , constructing a complete set of MUBs is possible only when  is a prime power. For composite dimensions that do not fit this form, full sets of MUBs remain elusive. To address this gap, researchers develop approximate versions (AMUBs). In this talk, we’ll explore the properties and applications of MUBs, including their roles in Optimal State Determination, Entropic Uncertainty measures, and Entanglement properties. We’ll also discuss how projective and unitary design features of MUBs help us gauge how closely AMUBs approximate true MUBs.

*About the Speaker*
@uditanshu_sadual is a 2nd-year MSc Mathematics student with a keen interest in Number Theory, Algebra, and Topology—but he’s easily tempted by an array of other topics too. His talk is inspired by his summer internship at ISI Kolkata, where he worked under Prof. Subhamoy Maitra in Quantum Cryptography. Outside academia, you’ll often find him dancing or playing the flute, and he’s quite active on Instagram as well!

🗓 *Date*: 30/10/2024
📍 *Venue*: MZ195, Mathematics Department Committee Room
⏰ *Time*: 2-3 pm

Caption: We are excited to introduce a new lecture Talks Series that will explore a variety of fascinating topics in mathematics! 🎉 This initiative aims to bring together enthusiasts to delve into innovative ideas and research findings that shape the mathematical landscape. 📊

First Talk: Using Sperner's Lemma to Bridge the Divide 
Speaker: Salil Gokhale

Abstract: The Rent Division Problem poses a practical question: given n housemates and a n-bedroom house with a fixed rent, how can we assign rooms and divide the rent in a way that ensures everyone is "satisfied"? 
In this talk we will explore an elegant solution to this and related problems in Fair Divison using Sperner's Lemma, a seemingly unrelated combinatorial result.

About the Speaker
Salil is a final year undergraduate student in the Mathematics Department. He enjoys working on design and analysis of algorithms for combinatorial settings. In particular, he has worked on Fair Division and Stable Matchings before, which are problems at the intersection of Computer Science and Economics. In his free time, he likes to attend non-academic quizzes happening in Delhi.

🗓 Date: 23/10/2024
📍 Venue: MZ195, Mathematics Department Committee Room 
⏰ Time: 2-3pm

Join us for this engaging discussion that bridges mathematical theory with practical applications! Discover how combinatorial principles can lead to innovative solutions in everyday challenges. Don't miss out! 🌟

Caption: Hello x :x ∈ (IIT Delhi :) )
MathSoc presents our first event of this academic year...Poker Tournament!! Poker: The art of calculating odds while pretending you don’t have a clue. Where bluffing is a function and winning is the limit! The first round, conducted online, saw over 200 participants entering the fray, each optimizing their strategies to advance. 
From this impressive pool, 20 elite players advanced to the high-stakes second round, held in the LHC across three intense poker tables.
After complex calculations of probability, bluffing functions and game theory in action these folks emerged as the ultimate champions:-

1) Shaurya Tyagi @shaurya_tyagii
2) Vatsal Malav @vatsalm47
3) Tanish Kumar @tanisshhh28
