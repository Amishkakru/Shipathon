Caption: ‚ÄúAll the world‚Äôs a stage, and all the men and women merely players.‚Äù Ladies and gentlemen, we present to you ‚ÄòThe Literary Club of IIT Delhi‚Äô! Through this release and two others, we will introduce you to its incredible cast, and also give a glimpse of how they are perceived by their peers, in the words of their very own co-reps! So stay tuned!

Hemang:
With his fanny pack and maggi hair, Hemang is quite hard to miss. A really good friend, with his ability to match any vibe; whether it is listening to your angry rants or excitedly going on about Geronimo Stilton at BYOBs. Due to his knack for writing, he is the designated creative guy of the rep team.

Krish:
You‚Äôll most likely find him draped on a sofa, playing Scrabble. Dirty glasses, dishevelled hair and his messed-up sense of humour are the first things you‚Äôll see when you meet him. If you ever wanna have conversations about LOTR or Harry Potter, he‚Äôs your guy. One of the funniest guys I know (he made me put this part in), and one of the nicest too (this one is true).

Amogh:
A jolly guy with a contagious smile, Amogh is always in for a bit of tomfoolery. Try not to be offended if he asks for your sexual preferences XD. Amogh‚Äôs memory might come in handy if you need the dates of last year‚Äôs Scrabble or smth like that

Tanya Batra:
A classic Punjabi tadka.  With a strong personality and a heart full of kindness, she definitely is the Rachel ‚Äî a bold, inspiring presence who knows how to command a room and still make everyone feel seen. PhD by profession (just to have something to rant about). And probably Dances her problems away.

Gunveen: 
Whenever you come to a lit event, just wait for a minute and you will see her jumping excitedly somewhere in the room. A good friend, she‚Äôll help you forget your troubles by annoying you(which is a trouble you‚Äôll grow to like soon enough) and is always open for a fun convo;
PS: keep your specs safe from her.

Caption: "Et two, Brute?" As promised, we present The Literary Club of IIT Delhi-Meet the Team 2! This sequel to the first post introduces you to six more members, with, of course, captions by their co-reps!

Adit:
The perfectionist diva of LitClub! Resident homeboy of Central Library! Don't let his cold demeanor get to you, beneath this grammar nazi is a typical haryana guy. Like all CS peeps, a chic magnet with nerdy rizz. Ask him for a Nescafe treat anytime you see him; he can never say no to a cup of coffee!

Atiksh: 
When he does decide to show up to a lit event,he might be among the first people you notice.With his sweater and bad jokes ready, he might be funny or annoying.Probably both.
Jai Jwala!

Sabhya:
You might have noticed a tall and lean, pink bag guy lounging around Shivalik-yep, that's him. A seasoned badminton player and rookie word games enthusiast, he always has something witty up his sleeves. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask him for help with an assignment-he isn't good at saying no.
PS He does not know about Peeves(Why?)

Hemanth:
To find Hemanth, just spot the shyest, most unamusing chocolate boy in the room. Bored out of your mind?Poke him with a stick, and brace yourself for a 2-hour TED Talk on everything from obscure pagan goddesses to Sanderson fanfics, from flaunting his Victorian vocabulary to unloading the trauma inflicted by the physics dept.
Pro tip:toss a pun at his surname, and you‚Äôll unlock that priceless frustrated but helpless smile.

Tanmay:
If you attend a lit event, you'll find a tall, sly-looking creature slithering amidst innocent freshers. Beware, you‚Äôve spotted Tanmay Sahu! A true patriot to his hostel, he‚Äôs bound to bring Jwala up somehow ten seconds into a conversation. And speaking of convos, make sure not to have one with him after two in the night, or brace yourself for lifelong trauma.

Neel:
Meet my friend, a poetic sage(not like Kabir), a modern Osho(Maybe like him) with a flair for Gujarati verses. He dreams of devouring books(like daily) but ends up binge watching movies instead, like a true connoisseur of cinema. With old school tastes and a heart that beats to a timeless rhythm, he‚Äôs single, but also, committed to his passion.
