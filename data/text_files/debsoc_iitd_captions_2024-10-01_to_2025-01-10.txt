Caption: We're thrilled to announce our CAs for Vacanza- Nikhil and Abhinav! 

In @notinaroosh 's words:
Leaving all the emo stuff for our farewell debates, Abhinav has had my absolute respect for his  absolute hunger for debating (read: winning at debating xD) and mighty effective growth trajectory. The perspectives and clarity he brings to the table mirrors his character in real life. Your initial impression of this guy would probably be ki ye completely back**d launda hai who doesn't care too much about the activity itself. But just like every other aspect of his life, Abhinav has been meticulous, disciplined and humble in his growth in debating, barring the occasional slip ups ofcourse xD. 
I am pretty sure the fourth and fifth motion he drafts would be quite amazing ones to debate on (shuru mein toh silly cheezein hi sochta hai ye sadly) and I have no doubts he will fulfill his CA responsibilities well

In @hari.shivaani 's words:
Nikhil is someone who has always amazed me with his diverse talents, and the number of things that he is able to juggle at once. 

The first time I met him was in a Stalwarts practice debate before the outrounds, where he absolutely crushed me. That experience ended up being the start of our friendship, and we then teamed up for Intra in our first year. His enthusiasm throughout was what made me keep showing up to debate and adj in almost every round of the tournament.

Nikhil's appreciation for the art of debating, coupled with his eager enthusiasm at the prospect of cooking motions is the reason why him CAing this tournament is bound to make it a great experience for all debaters!

Caption: Farewell Post #8 | @shah.rahul.r 
In the words of @kumar_arjun08, @prisha23jain and @shub_310_ 
Rahul’s farewell post might just be the most poignant one, given how much he means to so many of us. Being the secretary has its perks, you get to spend a lot of time with everyone, building unique bonds along the way. And yet, despite all the camaraderie, my relationship with Rahul has been anything but smooth sailing at times. I wouldn’t describe myself as his biggest fan, nor would I say I’ve been the easiest junior to deal with. 

I still vividly recall the fights we had, like that memorable (or maybe infamous) night in the Zanskar mess. And let’s not forget how obnoxiously I outdid him in Round 3 of the AmProAm, inadvertently costing him his break. Looking back, I realize I’ve not exactly been the model junior anyone would hope for. But despite my flaws, Rahul has always been steadfast in his support for me. 

I remember him helping me prepare for my very first tournament, patiently walking me through how to adjudicate, a conversation that ultimately led to me securing a break the very next day. That moment was a turning point for me, and Rahul was instrumental in making it happen. In fact, he’s the reason I’ve stayed connected to Debsoc all these years. 
 Over the years, Rahul has been an unwavering source of encouragement, someone I could always count on no matter the circumstances. Beyond his role as secretary or debater, he has been the life of the party, always ready to light up a room with his wit, energy, and undeniable charm. 

Rahul is truly one of a kind—not just as a leader or a speaker, but as a person. From celebrating his happiest moments, like when he won the elections, to seeing him stressed on the eve of an MTL107 quiz, I’ve witnessed the full spectrum of his journey. Through it all, he has been a profoundly positive influence in my life. 

As I write this, it’s hard to accept that the time has come to bid him farewell. Rahul, your impact on me and on Debsoc is immeasurable. Thank you for everything, you’ll be deeply missed, but your legacy will continue to inspire us all.
-Arjun

Caption: Farewell post #7 | @parth_singhal28 

In the words of @shub_310_ , @kumar_arjun08 and @suswagya - 

Who would have imagined that the senior who scolds you the most, crushes you in chess with zero mercy, and always delivers the harshest reality checks would become one of the closest people in your life? That has been my journey with Parth—a senior, a mentor, a friend, and an elder brother rolled into one. Together, we’ve shared some of the best and worst moments of our lives, and every step of the way, he has left an indelible mark on me. 

I can still recall the day I became a rep—and also the day I cried because of you, Parth. You were brutal, absolutely relentless. I walked out of that interaction feeling crushed, questioning if I could ever live up to your expectations. But looking back, I realize that it wasn’t just scolding—it was the push I needed to rise to the occasion. And when I did, you were also the one who celebrated my victories, guided me through my mistakes, and gave me the confidence to face challenges head-on. 

You didn’t just teach me how to navigate college life; you made it memorable. Whether it was dragging me to parties I wouldn’t have attended on my own, giving me the most candid and invaluable fundae during placements, or simply prioritizing me like an elder brother would—you were always there. Your room became our haven, a place we’d visit frequently, where hours would slip by as we played endless rounds of chess, made fun of Gopal’s unsual habits in front of him (@gops.crlm710 ) and soaked in your wisdom. I can’t count how many times you gave us reality checks, but each one came from a place of care, shaping us into better versions of ourselves. 

In Debsoc, you were nothing short of a legend. Parth, you were the perfect mix—approachable and supportive when it came to your juniors, yet absolutely fierce when you stood to speak.

Caption: Farewell post #6 | @gops.crlm710 

In the words of @not_just_another_saksham and @ad_atharva - 

When we came in as freshers we were all told to respect the senior-junior boundary and somehow we were forced to be cautious when we were around seniors, I believed the same until I met Gopal. I recall, when I saw Gopal for the first time in his typical Gopal fashion, he delayed the room single-handedly by half an hour. He walked in with the signature “Gopal Goatee” and clothes that he probably hadn’t changed since days but in the next 7.33 mins Gopal displayed his prowess as a debtor. He uniquely masked his knack for debating by uniquely including crude humour in his speeches, his hand gestures especially were something that required panels to take special note of xd. Not only was he one of the most liked and chill seniors in the Soc but he also won the most internal tournaments in his year displaying his debating acumen. For all juniors Gopal was more like a friend rather than a typical “senior.” Fast forward to 2024, 

I can surely say that the guy is more like a brother to me and easily one of my best friends at campus. Its hard to contemplate how we went from having competitive case prep sessions to pulling off all nighters for roaming around campus (though it was seldom difficult to spot him at night on campus 😂), discussing random shit. Unsurprisingly, Gopal is more proud of being a West-Delhi boy with insane FIFA skills than being an IITian. When his plan for being remembered on campus via RDV PORs after not so good poltu, Gopal resorted to a cooler way of being remembered on campus through his signature drink “Gopal’s Special” @ CCD, which certainly remains a bestseller even after his graduation. Being kind, helpful, and insightful while achieving so much with his never ending thirst for bakchodi is something very rare to find on campus. 

Please know that you’ll be dearly missed,
 “not-so-chindi” Gopal.

Caption: Farewell Post #5 | @saple._._ 

In the words of @harsh_ag_2703 and @mrigannkk - 

Writing a farewell post for Saple(aka Harsh) is possibly the easiest and the toughest thing to do at the same time. Having apparently 1732456 similarities between us and random ass connections, you can imagine Saple to be exactly a bigger but slightly weaker version of mine :p , jk the man is perfect in whatever he does. 

Saple, in debates always had this competitive urge to win, which seems pretty unnatural for a geek like him, he would always show up to judge qualifiers,in rounds, stalwarts, be there at IITPDs, helping with rooms, and of-course be ready to have the post alcohol talk on the roof ( sudhar jaao smh). The one thing( not really there’re many xD) that I always admire about him is the way he was always constantly pushing me as well as Talin whenever any of us needed help, be it in our rep tenure, be it as freshers and be there for every hostel workshop we took, showed the true nilbul he was ( @freshers For reference this is how seniors should be, not like the ones you’ll meet in April next year!) 

Lastly, I don’t think I would’ve lasted in this college if not for Saple, who would listen to my constant rants about not getting shortlisted during my interns, to being so paranoid about my interviews, the man always had a way to deal with every situation, I know I tend to simp a lot on him ( hehe), that’s because of the immense respect and trust I have in him, lastly, thank you for everything, and have fun in Hong kong, and itni daru peena chodd do bsdk, Nilgiri and Debsoc will miss you! Farewell <3
