Caption: Be Strong, it doesn’t take long”! 
For ages, the physical well-being had been the fulcrum for enjoying good life and numerous ideas and activities promoted ‘physical fitness as the thing’. With rapidly changing socio-techno-economic considerations and radically changed life-styles, increasingly people are now paying attention to the other critical half – “the Mental Well-being” 
To celebrate World Mental Health Day, we at IITDAA have conceptualised, The Thrive Hive, an initiative to take forward targeted interventions to promote the Mental and Holistic Well-being of the IITD community. 
We conducted a workshop on Emotional Alchemy for Success (28/9) during the cultural festivities of Rendezvous. 
The unique speaker session-cum-workshop was designed to empower participants to unlock their potential by cultivating emotional intelligence and resilience - essential skills in today's rapidly changing world.
The Speakers were 
- Rachna Pande (IITD alumna 2006 Biotech, SM from MIT, former AVP-Technology at Zomato, startup Founder and Chief of Technology at a non-profit). 
- Garima Gupta (IITD alumna 2005 Computer Science, formerly with McKinsey & Co and in non-profit leadership roles, founder of The Swasth Institute)
Instead of focussing on success stories, the speakers shared their personal experiences in overcoming challenges and transforming them into opportunities through inner awareness. 
The 2-hour session was filled with rich sharing from participants, reflective activities designed to reveal self-judgments, strengths and newer perspectives. Along with practical tools to enhance emotional resilience and navigate life effectively, participants took away valuable insights around believing in themselves, having courage, replacing stress with joy.
The session offered meaningful insights for handling personal and professional lives.

Caption: World Mental Health Day is celebrated on 10th October every year and we at IITDAA have put special emphasis on the Mental and Holistic Well-being of our IITD community. ‘The Thrive Hive’ is a signature initiative of IITDAA, dedicated to fostering well-being, resilience, and personal growth for our community. 
As part of a student-alumni engagement initiative, few members of the IITDAA Executive Committee; Mr. @kalpen.shukla , Ms. @Garima and @doctorlight.official Ph.D., visited various Girls’ and Boys’ hostels recently to interact directly with students. The focus of these conversations was to gain insights into the students' mental health and overall campus experience, offering support and practical advice for navigating the demanding environment of IITD life.
During these candid discussions, alumni shared valuable "survival tips" based on their own experiences, helping students better cope with the increasing pressures of academic life. There is clearly academic stress among students, and it became clear that even extracurricular activities, once a source of fun and balance, have now evolved into high-stakes positions of responsibility aimed at building the perfect CV.
The pressure surrounding placements, staying relevant in a competitive world, and the search for one's true passion were recurring themes. The alumni, in turn, provided reassurance and guidance, emphasizing the importance of self-reflection, maintaining mental wellness, and finding a balance between ambition and personal fulfillment.
